Sorry this was 4 minutes late (lost track of time), it would be greatly appreciated if it could still be accepted.

This homework was about creating neural networks to solve Burger's equations. The trickest bit was
figuring out what the heck I was doing and understanding what burgers equation was about so that I could do 
it correctly. Once I understood what was happening it got simpler. I worked with Zach mckennedy and I 
did up through the L2 loss model, then Zach did the rest.

This assignment explored Dark Matter while having us learn how to deal with uncertainties in data and how they propogate through our analysis. According to Newtonian physics, once all the mass is added
in, the velocity at a given radius from the center of a galaxy is proportional to 1/sqrt(r). However, due to dark matter, this is not actually the case and Newtonian physics breaks down. 

The most interesting part of this for me was the realization that angular size is a big thing used in astro physics. I went on a little deep dive half way through working on the nitty gritty of how we measure the
size of really far away things.

I worked with Zach Mckennedy on this homework. I did data acquisition, exploration and calculation of the size and uncertainty of Andromeda. Zach did luminosity, and data visualization and then copied all the functions down to the milky way section

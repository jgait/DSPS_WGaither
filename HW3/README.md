# DSPS Homework 3

This homework covered a lot of basics of datascience. Data acquisition, data ingestion, data cleanup, data exploration and descriptive analysis on the data.
In this homework we sought to replicate the data from a paper by Alvaro Corral on scaling laws for the inter-event time of earthquakes of different magnitudes.

I enjoyed this assignment as I like working with pandas dataframes. It was a bit tricky at first as I had never worked with a date time indexed dataframe (as Zach set it up)
however I now understand it and will definitely use the technique in the future. 

I did the 'Select valuable data' and 'Data exploration sections' as well as the beginning of the 'Data analysis' section. Zach McKennedy did the rest.

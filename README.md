(William) Jensen Gaithers repository for the 2023 DSPS class

As a mechanical engineer interested in test and validation work, I was drawn to this class in order to expand my data analysis skills, particularly my understanding of big data techniques (Also I just love to learn). I am most interested in exploring big data analysis and machine learning. I think the greatest strength I bring to this class is a strong intuitive ability to see trends and patterns in data, as well as creativity in figuring out how to display said trends.

# Homework 2
This homework covered some concepts surrounding the basics of probability and probability distributions

The first exercise explored creating Maxwell Boltzman Distributions from chi distributions which are the more general case of the
Maxwell Boltzman equations. A cool thing I now know is that as Temperature increases, the mean velocity increases but also
the spread of velocities increases. 

The second exercise explored the central limit theorem and law of large numbers. We created many different samples of differing sizes from
a number of different distributions, then plotted their means and observed that as sample size increases, the sample mean converges to the 
theoretical mean. Finally we plotted histograms of the means and noted that as more and more samples are taken, the distribution of the means adopt 
normal distribution, as predicted by the CLT.

Zach Mckennedy did the Boltzmann exercise and I did the CLT exercise. We accidentally ended up each doing a whole assignment each, next
week we'll try to collaborate more.

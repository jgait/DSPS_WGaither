This homework had us explore linear regression via direct normal solve using linear algebra, an sklearn linear regression fit,
a fit via optimizing an objective function, and an MCMC fit. The trickiest part was figuring out the Chi2 objective function as we
had not had much exposure to it. I worked with Zach Mckennedy, I did the beggining up through the Chi2 objective function and then Zach 
did the rest.
